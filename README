CHANGELOG

0.5.4

- Bomberdamage corrected
   
0.5.3

- Artishots now can do critical hit damage

0.5.2

- Plasma turrets now do correct amount of critical hit (the part that hits the
ship crits, the AoE dont). This works by multiplying the critical hit dps by
1 - %AoE/100

    0.5.1 
    
    - Balistic turrets now work
    
    0.5
    
    - Calculator now calculates structure regen per second. This is based on 
    armor, the 'auomatic repairs' passive skill, and emergency repairs. Fully 
    upgraded emergency repairs gives you 600 points every 60 seconds, so this
    would get you a regen of 10 points / s. Every armor percent gives 0.1
    additional structure points per second.
    
    0.4.4
    
    - Command field is now working. Keep in mind that buffs only affect the 'effective dps'.
    
    0.4.3
    
    - cleaned up the html.
    
    0.4.2
    
    - now squadrons really work
    
    0.4.1
    
    - Made calculate_dps_skills easier to maintain and a lot faster
    - calculate_dps_guns is now twice as fast
    - calculate_ehp not twice as fast
    
    0.4
    
    - There is now a 'sieged mode' checkbox available if you choose artillery 
    ship. In sieged mode, only DPS of the SHC and the artillery-skills is cal-
    culated.
    - Squadrons are now taken into account
    - Fixed for patch 1.12b. Old data still available in the data_patch_1_12.js file.
    - Fixed bug where some skills would be added multiple times
       
    0.3.3
    
    - updated for patch 1.12. old data is still available in the data_patch_1_11.js file.
    
    
    0.3.2
    
    - there is now a 'compare to actual build' button. This way you can better fine-tune 
    your build. Just make a build, press the 'compare to this' button, then make 
    changes and press calculate as often as you want to see how everything changes.
    The dotted lines represent your old build
    - Made everything easier to maintain. Now, if a new ship or skill is added, 
    you just have to add it to the 'database'. Thats it, no programming required 
    (if it fits one of the types). It just works and is automatically added to 
    the drop-down-menu(s) the only thing used for skills is 
    skill[id][11][techlevel], anyway.
    
    
    V 0.3.1
    
    - changed the colors back to the normal ones, if you compare a build the new lines are now dotted
    
    
    V 0.3
    
    - you can now load a second build to compare your current one to
    - more information: dps min/max guns, dps min/max skills, ehp min/max, shields min/max
    - dps skills is now calculated before dps_guns, because it now also calculates the skill buffs
    - priority target now taken into account
    - skill dps calculation now a lot more efficient and easier to maintain
    - new graph: total gun-dps over range (im just throwing all kind of features in there, let me know when they are useless)
    * for this graph, rangeupgrades and radar beacon are taken into account. did you know that the maximum archievable range is almost 130 units?
    * right now, you have to take radar beacon yourself to see the effect
    * keep in mind that the whole program currently doesnt work with artillery ship, only unsieged damage is taken into account
    - graphs now have relative placement instead of absolute.

    
    V 0.2.1 02.04.2012
    
    -effective DPS now rounded
    -replaced all 'new Array()' with literal array notation '[]', should speed 
    things up a little.
    -better readability for 80 column displays.
    -moved form-functions to janitor.js
    -general code-cleanup
    
    
    V 0.2 02.04.2012
        
     - groundbreaking technology now calculated in 5 rows instead of 73
    - dps for skills now calculated. following skills are taken into account:
    *quantum leap
    *scannerj
    *tracker
    *rocket battery
    *missile battery
    *torpedoes
    *shockwave
    -combined DPS now calculated. thats (skill_dps+gun_dps)*skill_buff
    -fixed size of diagrams
    -ehp diagram now shows ehp (red) and shield (green) seperately.
